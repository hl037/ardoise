   <h2>Introduction </h2>
   <p>
   Ardoise is a drawing program whose the drawing surface is automatically expanded when needed. <br/>
   It is primarily intended for peoples who need to do a lot of drafts, or schema and explanatory diagrams using a palette of defined colors. <br/>
   It is also suitable for children to make pretty pictures. <br/>
   However, as with any software, before to be effective, you must become accustomed to the keyboard shortcuts. This is the main subject of this help.
   </p>
   <h3> Advanced Usage: </h3>
   <p>
   The slate has a palette system to easily store and restore a brush: Each keyboard letter is assigned to a brush that can be:
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>empty</li>
      <li>thicknesses</li>
      <li>colors</li>
      <li>colors and thicknesses</li>
   </ol>
   <p>
   Thus, when restoring an empty brush, nothing changes. When you restore a "thick brush", only the thickness are recovered, and the colors are unchanged. For a color brush, the opposite happen : only the colors are restored. Eventually, when you restore a "colors and thickness brush", both colors and thickness are restored. <br/>
   Each brush is represented by a letter key ([a] to [z]), you just need to press one to restore the corresponding brush. <br/>
   It is possible to save the current colors in a brush by A-(letter), to save the current thickness by S-(letter). <br/>
   Note: re-save the same thickness or the same color in the same letter resets it. (See shortcuts) <br/>
   Finally, it is also possible to save (CA-s) and open (o-CA) a pallet.   </p>
   <h2> Shortcuts </h2>
   <h3> Notations: </h3>
   <p>
   modifier keys (to maintain support for any combination): <br/>
   C-(letter): Control <br/>
   A-(letter): Alt <br/>
   S-(letter): Shift <br/>
   CS-(letter): Control-Shift <br/>
   AS-(letter): Alt-Shift <br/>
   CAS-(letter): Ctrl-Alt-Shift <br/>
   <br/>
   letters will be given in lowercase. <br/>
   </p>
   <h3> standard shortcuts: </h3>
   <p>
   C-s save <br/>
   C-o open <br/>
   <br/>
   (<br/>
   future functions: <br/>
   C-c to copy <br/>
   C-v paste <br/>
   )
   </p>
   <h3> shortcuts for Basic use </h3>
   <p>
   &lt;space&gt; Changes the mode (text / drawing) <br/>
   NUM_PAD_1 Allows you to choose the color of the left click <br/>
   NUM_PAD_2 Allows you to choose the color of the right click <br/>
   <br/>
   C-+ / C-- Allows you to increase / decrease the thickness of the left click brush<br/>
   A-+ / A-- Allows you to increase / decrease the thickness of the right click brush<br/>
   </p>
   <h3> shortcuts for Advanced use</h3>
   <p>
